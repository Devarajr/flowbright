## Project Description:
Clean and plentiful water provides the foundation for prosperous communities. We rely on clean water to survive, yet right now we are heading towards a water crisis.  Flowbright is a cost-effective solution that will allow us to transform our relationship with water.  Flowbright allows users to closely monitor their water consumption and provide analytics on their usage periodically.  With the money users saved on using Flowbright, we partnered up with Charity water.  Users can easily donate any portion of their saving 

We use:
* Keen IO
* Electric Imp API
* Hichart API
* Firebase API
* Twitter Bootstrap framework
