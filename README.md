## Project Description:
Clean and plentiful water provides the foundation for prosperous communities. We rely on clean water to survive, yet right now we are heading towards a water crisis.  Flowbright is a cost-effective solution that will allow us to transform our relationship with water.  Flowbright hardware component sends water pressure data wirelessly to our firebase database. Flowbright then analyzes the collected data using keen io and present in various chart via hichart API. This allows users to closely monitor their water consumption and provide analytics on a granular level.  Flowbright also allows users to set up alert when abnormal water usage activities occured via Twilio APIs. Additionally, we partnered up with Charity Water where users can donate any portion of their saving from using Flowbright with just a button away. 

We use:
* Keen IO
* Electric Imp API
* Hichart API
* Firebase API
* Twilio API 
* Twitter Bootstrap framework
